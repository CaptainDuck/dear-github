Dear @github,
I decided to sign this letter because I solely believe that this is unfair.
Why should such a big community like the ImagicalMine community just disappear like this? I hope that this "hacker", or admin rights abuser will be banned, and this message to be showed to any other rights abuser that they will be banned and that they should learn a lesson. Please help the @ImagicalCorporation achieve what they have asked for, as I am a proud supporter with them. Thank you GitHub, for all that you do for us.
