Dear @github,
I decided to sign this letter because I solely believe that this is unfair.
Why should such a big community like the ImagicalMine community just disappear like this? I hope that this message will be shown to any other rights abuser that they should be taught a lesson. Please help the @ImagicalCorporation achieve what they have asked for, as I am a proud supporter with them. Thank you GitHub, for all that you do for us.
